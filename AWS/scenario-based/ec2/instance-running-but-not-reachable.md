## An EC2 instance is running but not reachable. What could be the reasons?

**Answer-** If an EC2 instance is running but not reachable, I first check **networking (public IP, route table, IGW), then security (security group and NACL), followed by OS-level issues like SSH service, disk space, or CPU exhaustion.** I also verify EC2 status checks and use SSM or EC2 Instance Connect for recovery if direct SSH is not possible.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Approach

#### 1️⃣ Instance & AWS Health Checks

**Goal:** Confirm instance state

✔ **Instance state:** Running \
✔ **System Status Check:** Passed \
✔ **Instance Status Check:** Passed

**If failed:**
- System check failed → AWS host issue → **Stop/Start or Recover**
- Instance check failed → OS issue → **SSM / volume recovery**

#### 2️⃣ Identify Connectivity Type

**Goal:** Are you connecting via public or private access? \
🔹 Public access → Internet → EC2 \
🔹 Private access → Bastion / VPN / Direct Connect

#### 3️⃣ Network Layer Issues

**❌ No Public IP / Elastic IP**

- Instance in public subnet but no public IP attached
- Elastic IP not associated

**✅ Fix:**

Attach a public IP or use **Elastic IP**

**❌ Route Table Misconfiguration**
- 0.0.0.0/0 not routed to Internet Gateway

**✅ Fix:**
Ensure the route table has:

```code
0.0.0.0/0 → igw-xxxxxxxx
```

**❌ Internet Gateway Missing**

- VPC has no IGW attached

**✅ Fix:**

Attach an **IGW** to the **VPC**

#### 4️⃣ Security Layer Issues

**❌ Security Group Blocking Traffic**

- SSH (22) / HTTP (80) / HTTPS (443) not allowed
- Source IP not allowed

**✅ Fix:**

Allow required ports from the correct CIDR:

```code
SSH → 22 → Your IP
HTTP → 80 → 0.0.0.0/0
```

**❌ Network ACL Blocking Traffic**

- Inbound or outbound rules deny traffic

#### 5️⃣ OS / Instance-Level Issues

**❌ Disk Full or CPU Exhausted**

- Root disk full → SSH fails
- CPU at 100%

**✅ Fix:**
- Check via EC2 System Logs
- Increase disk or instance size

#### 6️⃣ AWS Health & Status Checks

**❌ Failing EC2 Status Checks**

- System status check failure → AWS infrastructure issue
- Instance status check failure → OS issue

**✅ Fix:**

- Stop/start instance
- Recover instance
- Rebuild from AMI
