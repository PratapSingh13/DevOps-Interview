**A pod is stuck in the Pending state. How will you troubleshoot? What are the possible causes?**
   
**Answer-** A pod in Pending means **Kubernetes has accepted the pod, but it has not been scheduled onto any node.**

### 🏆 One-Line Summary (For Interviews)

A pod remains in Pending state when the scheduler cannot find a suitable node due to resource shortages, scheduling constraints, storage issues, or policy restrictions. The fastest way to diagnose is by checking pod events using ```kubectl describe pod```.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Approach
**1️⃣ Check Pod Events**
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```
👉 Look at the Events section at the bottom. **This usually tells you exactly why scheduling failed.**

#### ⚠️ Common Causes & How to Identify Them

🔹 **Insufficient Cluster Resources (CPU / Memory)**

**Symptom in events:**
```
0/5 nodes are available: insufficient cpu / insufficient memory
```
#### How to fix:

- Reduce resource requests \
- Add more nodes \
- Enable Cluster Autoscaler

🔹 **Node Selector / Affinity Mismatch**
**Symptom in events:**
```
node(s) didn't match node selector
```

#### Why it happens:

- Pod has nodeSelector, nodeAffinity, or podAffinity rules \
- No node matches the required labels

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

**Fix:**

- Update pod selectors \
- Add correct labels to nodes

```bash
kubectl label node <node-name> env=prod
```

🔹 **Taints and Tolerations Issue**

**Symptom:**
```
node(s) had taint {key=value:NoSchedule}
```

#### Why it happens:

- Node is tainted \
- Pod does not tolerate the taint

**Check taints:**
```bash
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```
**Fix (add toleration):**
```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "dedicated"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "frontend"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

🔹 **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Not Bound**

**Symptom:**
```
pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims
```

Why it happens:

- PVC exists but no matching PV \
- StorageClass misconfigured

**Check**
```bash
kubectl get pvc
kubectl get pv
```

**Fix:**

- Create PV \
- Fix StorageClass \
- Ensure correct access mode & size

🔹 **Pod Requests Special Resources**

**Examples:**

- GPUs \
- HugePages \
- Custom device plugins

**Symptom:**
```
Insufficient nvidia.com/gpu
```

**Fix:**

- Add suitable nodes \
- Reduce special resource requests

🔹 **Namespace ResourceQuota Limit Reached**

**Symptom:**
```
exceeded quota
```

**Check:**
```bash
kubectl describe quota -n <namespace>
```

**Fix:**

- Increase quota \
- Reduce pod requests
